# Overview

I want to learn more about mobile app development. The reason I choose iOS is that SwiftUI's declarative syntax simplifies the construction of user interfaces, allowing developers to focus more on functionality rather than style details. 

This is a weather app, but you can customize what you want to show by checking the info that you want to show.

The purpose to develop this app is allow user to decide what kind of info that they want to show. Users can choose what they want.

# Development Environment

The tool that I going to use is Xcode which is a developing software for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS. I might also use YouTube to help me get some help for it.

This is a iOS app, so it is important to use swift to develop the app
