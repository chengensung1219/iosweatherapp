# Overview

I want to learn more about mobile app development. The reason I choose iOS is that SwiftUI's declarative syntax simplifies the construction of user interfaces, allowing developers to focus more on functionality rather than style details. 

This is a weather app. It can show the weather details at your local place according to your current location. The weather details include the sunrise & sunset, the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.


The purpose of developing this app is to provide users with a nice look, clean, and easy-to-use weather app without giving a lot of weather info to confuse users. We aim to focus on important weather information.

# Development Environment

The tool that I going to use is Xcode which is a developing software for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS. I might also use YouTube to help me get some help for it. Furthermore, the OpenWeather API is a really important API that allows us to grab the weather data.

This is an iOS app, so it is important to use SwiftUI and Xcode to develop the app.
